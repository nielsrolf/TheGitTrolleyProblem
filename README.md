# The Trolley Problem
This repository is an alternate universe that revolves around the trolley problem. The reality of the universe is whatever the master branch says it is.

# What is happening?
At this point in time, there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. On a side track, there is one person tied to the tracks. Coincidentally, there is also a fat man on a bridge above the track. If you do nothing, the other contributor, physics, will soon update master such that the trolley kills the five people.

You `checkout` all branches reality can take it this point, and find that among others there is a `lever` and a `fatman`. Which is the more ethical option?:
- `git pull lever`
- `git push origin fatman:master`
